# Dual Mode Typing Test (Keyboard Only)

This is a simple, single-page typing test application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features two interactive typing modes designed for keyboard-only navigation.

## Modes

- **Write Mode**  
  Type a randomly generated paragraph within a 30-second countdown. Your words per minute (WPM) and accuracy are tracked in real time, with color-coded feedback for correct (green) and incorrect (red) inputs.

- **Character Mode**  
  Train with individual characters displayed in a carousel. This mode tracks your WPM and characters per second (CPS). A finger diagram highlights which finger to use for the current character. You can also toggle the inclusion of numbers by pressing the dash key ("-").

## How to Use

1. **Open the `TypeTest.html` file** in your browser.  
2. You will see a landing page with instructions:
   - Press **W** to start **Write Mode**.
   - Press **C** to start **Character Mode**.
   - Press **Esc** at any time to return to the landing page.
3. In **Character Mode**, toggle the inclusion of numbers by pressing **"-"**.
